I studied Japanese really hard in Switzerland! That's why I can speak it now.
Words aren't the only way to connect people's hearts together... I think that's amazing!
Goals?! Gah, I don't like the sound of that...
Okay! Let's have some fun!
Oh no, this is the worst!
I wonder if people who like me will come to our live shows? I get giddy just thinking about it!
I'm just a normal girl who has practiced a lot to get where I am! Practice is the key!
I-I'm going to do my best!
Check out your new Present!
Listen	If our fans are having fun, I have fun too! It's twice the happiness!
