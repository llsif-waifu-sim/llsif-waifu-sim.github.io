My father is the captain of an ocean liner. Would you like to go for a ride sometime? The wind feels really nice!
With ships, swimming, and school idols, the best part about them is that you can wear a uniform! Cute ones are the best! â™ª
I'm involved in both swimming and being a school idol, but I want to go all out in both!
Unread stories? You should go read them.
A goal, huh? A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
I want to do a live since I have the time~ What about you?
Ho..hold on! I can't keep practicing on stage if we don't take a break~
Captain! You can use loveca stones when you want to replenish your LP!
I'll come with you, so let's practice together.
We can do a special practice! It sounds strong, so let's give it a try!
It looks like we got presents! That makes me happy~
Let's go recruit new members so that we can continue our club activities.
This is the What's New section. I tend to neglect this... so you should take a look.
An event, huh...? There isn't one every day, so let's try it out!
