How are you feeling? I'm feeling perfect.
I'll be counting on you today too.
Good job. Go rest up early and be prepared for tomorrow.
Good morning. What a great morning it is.
We can still keep on going.
It's already this late... The day passes by so quickly when I'm with you.
You're still awake? Geez... Staying up late is bad for you.
