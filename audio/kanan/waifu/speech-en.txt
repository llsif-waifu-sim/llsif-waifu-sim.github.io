No one can live alone! Let's support each other.
Huh? I will be here if you need me.
If you are worried about anything, you should talk to me.
Ah! That tickles~
You want to try diving together? It's okay, I will hold your hand.
Thinking about a problem I am worried about usually helps me clear my head before I go to sleep♪
Stop tickling me! You're going to give me goose bumps.
You want a hug? Come here♪
Haha. You seem to be becoming spoiled. This is quite poetic♪
Th-this is becoming a bit..... embarrassing.
You are surprisingly bold. What is it? Hehe~
