Ahh.. cute singing and dancing... but it's not really my thing.
Even if the sea and sky is very immense, I personally think they will be too small.
I was used to wearing cute costumes. From wearing diving suits to body lining, I am used to wearing anything♪
There are still some unread stories. Do you want to read them together?
What would today's goals be? I will support you.
I can still do a live show! Shall we participate?
You need to recover LP? Hmm. I don't really know.
What's a love stone? Maybe we can gather some if we try searching at the bottom of the ocean.
Can we stop now? My body is all tired.
We can do special practice. Good, let's go!
We have a present. I been waiting a long time for this, shall we open them?
Scouting? The more members we have, the more fun it will be♪
We have new information. We should stop fooling around and read them.
There is an event. It would be a shame to waste this opportunity, so let's go.
