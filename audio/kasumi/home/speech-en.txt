You think I'm cute? Hee hee, I get that a lot!
I don't really, you know, like being buddy-buddy just for show, but the school idol club isn't too bad!
Goals? Those are a breeze for me.
Come watch me perform!
Could you leave me alone for a bit?
I'm kind of worried that I'll gain even more fans!
Well, I'm perfect even without practice.
You're trying to make me even cuter?! Unbelievable. I'm...bubbling mad!
There's a present for you. Huh? No, it's not a bread bun!
There's no one on earth who isn't my fan.
