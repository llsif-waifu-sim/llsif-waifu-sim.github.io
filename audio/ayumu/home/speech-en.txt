I attend Nijigasaki High because the uniforms are adorable and it's close to home!
Together...our dreams can come true! We just need to walk forward, one step at a time.
A-A Goal? Let's go for it!
I'm ready to go whenever!
Sorry... No dice.
I want to share my dream with as many people as possible.
I'm ready for another day!
I truly believe that no matter how small the step, every inch forward is progress!
*Giggle* You've got a Present waiting.
