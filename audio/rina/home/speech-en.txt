Ugh...I'm so nervous. But it's okay. I'll try my best!
I've started to realize something. It's hard to share your feelings. But it's fun, too!
Goals...? I'm worried. But I'm excited, too.
I'll do my best...!
...I'm sorry.
I want lots of people to cheer for me. My heart's racing, but I feel floaty inside.
...I'll practice!
I'll...practice more!
Uh, uhm. You have a gift. See?
Ugh...I'm so nervous. But it's okay. I'll try my best!
