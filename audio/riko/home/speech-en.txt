Since I am from Tokyo, but I'm actually kind of dull, but I will do my best!
I just love to draw. Someday, I hope to draw Uchiura's beautiful seascape.
I really am not good at singing..... it will be better if we all practice more.
Looks like there are some stories you haven't read yet. Err, I'm not going to read them aloud to you.
Goals are quite challenging once they build up, but we can advance little by little each day.
I still have plenty of energy left, but I can take a break if you are tired.
Sm..... Small break.....uh......uh
It looks like if we recover our LP, we can immediately continue a liveshow.
There there, it's time to practice. Let's do our best♪
It looks like we can do special practice. What kind of practice is that?
You have recieved a present. Hehe, you're quite popular, huh♪
Why don't you go scouting? I am nervous..... however it's important that we meet the others.
Looks like we have new information. Do you want to take a look at them together?
There's an event in progress. I get stage fright in front of a big crowd... but I have to face my fear!
