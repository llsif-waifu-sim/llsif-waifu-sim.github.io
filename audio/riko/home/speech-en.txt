Since I am from Tokyo, I am not used to everything around here..... but I will do my best!
I like to paint. Do you think it would be nice if paint a picture of Uchira's beautiful sea someday?
I really am not good at singing..... it will be better if we all practice more.
It looks like we have unread stories. Well, I am going to read for a little bit.
Goals are quite challenging once they build up, but we can advance little by little each day.
I still have plenty of energy left, but I can take a break if you are tired.
Sm..... Small break.....uh......uh
It looks like if we recover our LP, we can immediately continue a liveshow.
There there, it's time to practice. Let's do our best♪
It looks like we can do special practice. What kind of practice is that?
You have recieved a present. Hehe, you're quite popular, huh♪
Why don't you go scouting? I am nervous..... however it's important that we meet the others.
Looks like we have new information. Do you want to take a look at them together?
There's an event going on. It makes me nervous seeing a lot of people there, however we should do it while it's still popular♪
