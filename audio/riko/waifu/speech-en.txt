If you want to practice singing our song, let's go to the music room. I can accompany you with the piano.
You want my help? Hey..... it's pointless to ask to copy my homework.
You said you like my piano.....? Thank you. I'm so happy to hear that. I feel a little braver now.
Are you hungry? I made this sandwich you can have, hold on a sec.
Ahhhh.....! Don't scare me like that~
Huh? I-I guess I am pretty boring after all.
It's bad if you don't tell me if you are okay or not!!
I-I know very well how uninteresting I am, *sniff*...
You're worried about me? ..... in fact, it is you that I am concerned about.
Hehe. Once in a while is goodâ™ª
Um..... when you do that sort of thing, it makes me nervous.
