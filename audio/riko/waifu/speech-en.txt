If you want to practice our song, let's go to the music room. I can accompany you with the piano.
You want my help? Hey..... it's pointless to ask to copy my homework.
You said you like my piano.....? Saying that really means a lot to me. It gives me courage.
Are you hungry? I made this sandwich you can have, hold on a sec.
Ahhhh.....! Don't scare me like that~
Eh? Ar-Are you okay.....?
It's bad if you don't tell me if you are okay or not!!
Yes, I am usually quiet, but..... um.....
You're worried about me? ..... in fact, it is you that I am concerned about.
Hehe. Once in a while is goodâ™ª
Um..... when you do that sort of thing, it makes me nervous.
