A warm spring has finally arrived.....ah-choo! Hey, why is it cold in spring? 
Summer's here. Shall we fall from grace together on the beach? Whoops. A typhoon's coming!
Fall is the time to read fallen poems from heaven. Do want to stop studying and join me?
It's cold ..... It's not that cold, I can feel the sunlightâ™ª
