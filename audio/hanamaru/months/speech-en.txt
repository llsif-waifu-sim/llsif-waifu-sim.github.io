You think there's something buried at the foot of the cherry tree? Ha, ha. I'm joking!
Ain't nothing better in the summer than reading in the shade... except eating watermelon after you're done!
I love books, so I love reading in autumn as well. The autumn of reading is my autumn♪
When it's cold, sometimes you can't help but feel lonely... At times like this, feel free to visit me♪
