If there's something I can do to help, just say the word!
Hmm? What am I reading? It's a book about the literary masters if the Meiji era.
Whattup? Oh, shoot. I mean, hello, did you call me?
Ack! Whoa, whoa! Don't touch me like that, you gave me shivers!
Forget about me. Go cheer on the others.
If you're that interested in what I'm reading, let's hit the library together.
Aah... Please stop.
I'd probably be more appealing if I were taller... but I don't drink milk.
Oh, could you pull me towards you just a bit? I wanna get a little taller, so just pullllll!
It seems that my heart beats faster whenever you touch me....
Whaa! What are you doing at a place like this?
