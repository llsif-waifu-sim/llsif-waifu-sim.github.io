I'll try hard too, and aim to become an even better school idol than my sister!
Y-Yes?! Did you call for me?
U-U-U-U-Um...What is it...?
Eeeeek! Please don't tickle me...
I remind you of a puppy? I get that a lot.
Wah! W-W-W-W-What's up?!
I wish everyone would stop treating me like a puppy already...
My big sis would say, "If you continue to touch me, then you'd best prepare yourself!"
It's embarrassing, but...once in a while is fine.
You know, whenever you and I get to talking, somehow my heart beats just a bit faster
We can't do that, not here!
