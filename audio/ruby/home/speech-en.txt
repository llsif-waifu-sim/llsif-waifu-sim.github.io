My big sister is always pretty hard on me...ooooh, sis...!
Even though I have nothing going for me...I can be proud of my love for school idols!
I've never been able to make it very far. But with everyone here, I've been able to make it a bit further!
I-I want to read the next story.
Hmm? A goal? As long as my big sis is here, I think I can do it...
I can still do a live show. Are you up for it?
I-I'm sorry...I just need... a little break.
To refill your LP, use a love gem. That's what my big sis told me.
I...wanna practice.
A special practice...I wonder if I can do it too.
Wha?! A present? W-What to do...I couldn't...
Ooh...even I can scout!
Whenever Hanamaru talks about new information, it makes me wanna take a look.
An event?! Would even I be able to join?
