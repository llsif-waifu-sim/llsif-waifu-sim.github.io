My home is actually an inn. It's not fancy, but you should come over and play!
The important thing is that everyone learned something from μ's. I want to fulfill people's dreams just like μ's!
I used to think that we could not accomplish anything without being in the city..... but I decided that we shouldn't think like that anymore
Ehhh! We still have more story left to read! 
I wonder if we can accomplish all those goals..... no, I can't think like this. We can do it!
Send me out quickly to do a liveshow~♪ I'm ready!
Ahh..... I am hungry..... after we rest, do you want to continue practicing? 
A break? But I can still sing!
We should practice! Let's do our best!
I can do special practice! Let's do it together!
We have presents? Yaay!
Club members are important! Let's go scouting!
It seems that we have new information. Let's check it out~
An event! I want to participate!
