Like μ's, I didn't know to much about becoming a school idol, but I always wanted to become one!
Everyday after school, everyone and I practice our dances. But I never get tired of doing it everyday♪
Running on the sandy beach makes me feel better whenever I feel anxious.
Good morningー♪　This weather is perfect for practice~！
Aqours will continue to work hard until the day we achieve our dreams!!
Ahh..... today was fun. Let's play again tomorrow, come practice with me♪
*Yawn* ..... I will, do my best.....
