"Hey, tell me about your summer plans"
"Invite me if you’re going somewhere"
I’ve been practicing for this; now I just need to call out to you
These conversations are impossible; I'm getting flustered

Just imagining it (Hot!! my summer time)
A bold me (Please love me, ah!)
I know that nothing will start with me just looking at you, so
Give me the courage to take one more step

LOVE!? shines in my heart with a sparkle
My yearning for love; an unsuppressible passion
LOVE!? I think that’s your fault
Even though I wish you would notice it, ah, I still can't say it!

A special relationship is still a mystery
I want to know when it'll come to be
Is it after we call each other by our names?
Or after we start walking arm in arm?

The summer nights (Hot!! my summer night)
When the number of my sighs increase (Please touch me, ah!)
Nothing bad will happen if I just keep looking
But it hurts to take a step back

RED!! Flickers the traffic light, we can't move forward
Love is dangerous, but that's why I'm so curious, of this passion
RED!! Your wink that's like sunlight is giving me a push
My lips open and yet,  "Hey...nevermind!"

(Hot!!)
(My summer)
(Please love me)

(What's this feeling?)
(Tell me!)

My summer LOVE!? shines in my heart with a sparkle
My yearning for love; an unsuppressible passion
LOVE!? I think that’s your fault
Even though I wish you would notice it, ah, I still can't say it!
