A maze of dreams... A maze of lilies...

When your eyes filled with longing
Are searching far away
I feel such loneliness
And want to tell you I'm right here

Ah! Just the two of us, to the Garden of Glass
There's no one else; we don't need anyone else
I want to bloom softly as if I'm about to break

On our secret swing
Swinging with you now
Just gazing at each other softly
A girl who's fallen in love with love; her quiet sigh is 
Lonely... contented and lonely...

So that your heart that I wish to capture
Won't go anywhere
Please stay here with me forever
It's lonely

Ah! In the maze of dreams, the glass butterflies
While tempting me, they're being tempted
I'll flap my fingers, as though they're about to break

Our secret romance
And even though I want to feel you
All we can do is painfully gaze at each other
The feelings we can't have as girls who are in love with love
Why do they have to be so painful?

We'll fall asleep in our Flower Garden
I love your hand as it strokes my hair; more...

Our secret romance
And even though I want to feel you
All we can do is painfully gaze at each other
The feelings we can't have as girls who are in love with love
Why do they have to be so painful?
On our secret swing
Swinging with you now
Just gazing at each other softly
A girl who's fallen in love with love; her quiet sigh is 
Lonely... contented and lonely...

A maze of dreams... A maze of lilies...
