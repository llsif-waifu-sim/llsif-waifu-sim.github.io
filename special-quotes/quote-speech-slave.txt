I think my birthday's the perfect occasion to give everyone a surprise. *Giggle* I hope they like it.
I've never had this many people come together to celebrate my birthday. It's a little embarrassing.
I'm so glad you all heard my song. I filled it with feelings of gratitude. It was my way of saying thanks.
*Giggle* Birthdays are always such happy days. So many people come up and wish you well!
I looked through my photo album on my birthday. Dia's always been looking after me, hasn't she?
Today's a special live show, so me and Dia got to stand center stage. I was so excited!
Since You invited me, I'm going to enjoy myself to my heart's content too!
It was You who named the inflatable raft. I've started to grow attached to it.
This inflatable raft looks like a toy, but it can actually travel quite far. We're on an adventure!
Boats really are the best! We can go anywhere on our inflatable raft, the SS You!
*Laugh* It's okay, Dia. You don't have to cling on so desperately.
Yeah, that's the way! I'm surprised by how great you are at rowing!
I'll remember the fluffy kindness of this sheep and deliver it to you during the live show.
We'll put you under a magic spell with our song.
I thought about giving the sheep open eyes, but I thought it gave off a kinder feeling with its eyes closed.
Here at last. The fallen angel's promised land, the magic metropolis, Tokyo! Here I come, my little demons.
The labyrinth of the magic metropolis warrants no fear before my magic eye! Come with me, Zuramaru and Ruby!
I can feel it. The darkness adorning the shining city lights is calling me, awaiting the time of my descent.
All right, sing along with us! Let's have a blast!
Don't worry! It's okay, because we'll always be together!
I can jump with all my might because I have You and Ruby by my side.
What does it mean to act like myself? I don't understand it yet, but I'm just gonna keep on running for now!
Let's press on, straight ahead! Don't be afraid because we'll be your guide!
Chika and Ruby, as long as I'm with the two of you, I can take on anything, head-first!
I'm gonna make sure you watch to see what I can do!
I can't just keep being scared. Even I get that now!
If Chika and You believe in me, then I'm gonna do my absolute Rubesty!
Can I bring this monkey home with me after the show? I want to keep it on my bed and sleep with it at night.
Thank you for always letting me stand on stage with happy feelings. I'll keep working hard!
I really like this monkey's eyebrows. Its slightly grumpy face is so cute!
Unlike stage costumes, Halloween ones are a little...embarrassing.
I also made some tomato cakes for Halloween. They're actually pretty good. Do you want one?
Halloween songs are a little spooky, but singing them with everyone makes them fun.
When someone says "trick or treat" to me, I always choose "treat"!
Jack-o'-lanterns are kinda interesting because there's a mix of cute ones and scary ones.
If you don't give me any candy, I'll pull a prank on you! If you do give me candy then... thanks? I guess?
In any language, maintaining eye contact with others in conversations is important. C'mon, give it a try.
Trying too hard to speak a foreign language will only bring nerves. Respect for the other person is key!
In a pinch, use gestures to speak with body language. Hey, Nozomi, that doesn't mean it's tickle time!
These cheerleader costumes came out really adorable!
Just wearing these matching cheerleading costumes is kind of making my heart flutter.
Pay close attention to my peppy cheerleader performance!
We also have to put our all into cheering so we don't get totally outshined by the sports clubs!
I'm sure at the end we'll all finish everything with a smile. The cards are telling me so.
Leave the passionate cheering to us!
I hope everyone at Otonokizaka can flourish. Gods, please make my wish come true.
Nozomi, Kotori, and I all made our wishes together, so I'm sure they'll have an immediate effect!
I'll give my all to cheer you on! Do your best, Otonokizaka!
I think Nozomi's fortune might be right, I'm gonna have the best day. Really gotta make my birthday special!
I'm glad I get to spend my birthday with you as well. Look forward to Alisa's special borscht!
Alisa planned my birthday party for me today. I'm really looking forward to it right now!
Ruby picked out temporary tattoos that would look good on me!
I got to walk around town, which was all decorated up for Halloween, with Ruby. It was fun, zura!
I really can't wait for our Halloween party, zura! I'm grateful to Yoshiko too, zura!
Temporary tattoos are so cute, aren't they? I wonder which ones will look the best on Hanamaru?
I tried to come up with the perfect Halloween outfits. Let's wear them together, later!
Hanamaru, Yoshiko, and I are going to have a party together. We did so much to prepare for it.
All the clothes in Tokyo are so stylish. There's so much to learn from just looking around like this.
Hanamaru, Yoshiko, and I all picked out some clothes. I'm gonna dress them up and add my own spin later!
I'm so glad I got to come to Tokyo with them. I'll do my Rubesty so we can make another trip!
*Giggle* Posing without a bow is difficult. You, does something like this look all right to you?
Hanamaru was kind enough to do a lot of research, and that deepened my interest in sports.
Kyudo is a martial art meant to hone the mind, while archery is a sport meant to hone physical skill.
I'm gonna run through a bunch of poses. Hanamaru, Dia, make sure you both get plenty of photos!
It seems like putting on fencing gear really improves my posture. It feels natural to pose in, too.
I tried my hand at a fencing trial lesson and it was a lot of fun. I'd love to give it another go!
Thanks to You's idea we collected a bunch of uniforms. I'm having so much fun, zura!
To me, fall was all about reading, but a fall full of sports is pretty exciting too.
Apparently, it's bad for horses to eat leafy vegetables. I had no idea, zura!
There's a magic spell that only affects those who watch our performances. You already know of it, right?
Today, we'll use our magic to bring you to a Harasho world. Are you ready?
You have to put important feelings into words. Thank you for everything. You're very special to me.
I wish every day was my birthday. That way I'd get treated to a feast every day!
I got a kitty-cat blanket as a present from everyone! It feels so amazingly soft!
No matter how cold it might be, I feel all nice and warm when I'm with everyone.
Somehow, seeing the fall-colored landscape tugs at my heartstrings and makes me feel wistful.
Wearing costumes with Japanese-style designs automatically makes me stand up straighter. I wonder why?
From the bottom of my heart, I'm truly happy to have friends that'll come to my rescue when I'm in trouble.
I tried to mix a more Japanese-style, subdued look with a flashier Western-style. How'd I do?
Japanese style and Western style look like different concepts, but they're adorable if you blend them well.
I tried to design this costume to evoke fall imagery, but it'd probably suit any season.
I tried matching my hairstyle to my outfit. Does the ponytail suit me?
The frills are supposed to look like whipped cream. They're fluffy and make me feel very sweet!
I feel like I could go to the land of candy in this costume. Maybe I'll try to embody that in our next song.
I'm gonna cast a super fun magic spell on you. *Giggle* It's a spell that'll make you smile.
I borrowed Honoka's magic wand. Now I'm a great witch, too!
I feel like this cloak will let me fly through the sky. Just one big leap to wherever you are!
Simmering miso soup after adding ingredients will enrich the flavor, but the aroma may fade, so be careful.
Bread's not bad either, but in the mornings, I definitely love to have my rice and my miso soup!
Ah, Rin, you've got some rice stuck to your mouth. Hehe, there, I got it for you.
Go! Go! Otonokizaka!
It's important to cheer with everything you have, and not act shy about it. Allegedly.
Honoka and the others are going to come cheer at the archery match. It's a bit embarrassing.
Maki! Umi! Let's get fired up!
It's so fun to be cheering with everyone!
When I see all the athletes working so hard, it makes me want to cheer even louder for them.
Rin and Umi's cheers are so powerful. I really admire them. I'll keep going too.
This was my first time cheering so wholeheartedly, but it was actually pretty fun once I tried it.
The songs and chants you use in cheers are so peppy and fresh. Maybe I'll refer to these in my next song.
The costume made from everyone's ideas is divinely gorgeous. Please look at every inch of it.
While I am used to wearing kimonos, this costume makes me feel nervous in a different manner.
I would like to show off this costume as much as possible, since it was thought up just for me.
The theme of my costume is a sachertorte, so I brought chocolate today as a treat!
The aura of bittersweet chocolate is perfect for Yohane's image. This is awesome!
Go on, imprint the sight of the fallen angel Yohane's new costume into your eyes. You'll be bewitched by it.
Whenever Shiitake sees Kanan, she looks so happy.
I bumped into Kanan while out on a walk, which was enough to make me feel like today's gonna be a great day.
Kanan is like a big sister to me and You.
It's been a while since I went for a walk with Chika and Shiitake. I wonder how far we'll go today.
For some reason, I got so excited running into Chika. It's been like that since we were kids.
You and Chika are like my little sisters. I really can't wait to watch them grow up.
Sweets are more artistically decorated compared to other foods. I could stare at them forever!
Come to think of it, did you know there are edible clothes? They're apparently made with milk-based fibers.
When there's something to celebrate, I'll say "congrats" with this costume instead of a cake, okay?
I came to pray at Kanda Shrine that we can all perform at Akiba Dome again someday.
More and more dreams I want to achieve keep bubbling up. I'll make them all happen with everyone in Aqours.
Please keep watching over Aqours and our growth!
Can you catch my ball? Augh, Mari, hugs are against the rules!
Chika and I are participating in the dribbling race. I just know it'll be a close match.
Dribbling a basketball is fun when the ball is nice and bouncy. It feels nice.
I hope you can receive my shiny smash!
Badminton is played indoors behind closed doors, right? So it feels kind of special to play it outside.
Kanan's good at badminton as well. If she and I formed a pair, we'd be unstoppable, don't you think?
Thanks to Kanan and Mari, we got first place!
You get more power than usual when someone's cheering for you. It's fun to cheer each other on!
Now that I've done a field day with everyone in Aqours, I've come to like field days more.
It's hard to make a big, neat-looking stick of cotton candy, but I want to pull it off and amaze everyone.
Cotton candy can be made into various shapes these days. I wonder what a μ's-themed one would be like.
When I finish making my cotton candy, I'll give you the first bite. Sit tight and look forward to it, okay?
I can gobble up a jiggly, refreshing bowl of almond tofu, even after a bowl of ramen!
Mango, strawberry, or orange... Argh! I don't know which almond tofu sauce to pick!
Let's pick different almond tofu sauces and go halfsies! Here's my half for you. Say "Ah!"
I feel like reindeer Rin is pulling me along, not a sleigh.
The way the children were so thrilled to get presents and broke into smiles was so precious and lovely.
Presents are a treat for children who have been good. Santa Claus is watching you.
I'm all charged up! Now I feel like I could run all over even if I had you on my back, Umi!
The reindeer is here! I'm going to circle the globe with Santa Umi, bringing happiness to all!
Having a party with everyone else is fun, but I also dream of a quiet celebration with milk and cookies.
Unicorn cakes are colorful and really pretty, aren't they? It's hard to decide which part to eat first.
Cute pastel costumes like these aren't bad every once in a while. Oh, I look good in it? Thanks!
Colorful fruit-flavored whipped cream! Which flavor would you pick?
Maki's rice balls and Hanayo's miso soup... This breakfast alone is already making me feel spoiled rotten!
A refreshing breakfast, a filling lunch, and a nourishing dinner. I could eat ramen for every meal!
Rice balls and miso soup are a golden combination. The best dish to top that off with is golden rolled eggs!
Go, go! Do your best out there!
The power of sports is amazing! Everyone's so fired up. This is the best day ever!
Now that I've cheered with all my might, I can see things more clearly. Thank you, everyone!
Honoka and Nico cheering next to me got me fired up, too!
This was a really wonderful opportunity for us to feel more connected to Otonokizaka.
When I see everyone trying their hardest, it makes me want to cheer even harder.
Eli, Honoka, you're not smiling enough! Take some lessons from yours truly!
I'm usually the one getting cheers, but it's nice to do the cheering too. I'll show you what Nico-Ni's got!
All right, let's pour our hearts into it and cheer loud! Follow my lead!
Tell me what parts of the costume you find cute. Me, I actually love all of it! It's sweet and adorable.
Mari brought lots of different sweets for us. Have a whiff. Smells nice and sweet, right?
I'm inviting you to the Aqours sweets party today!
There are lots of sweets in the world that I don't know of, zura.
I've always wanted a house made of candy, but a candy costume is pretty fantastical, too!
I wanna eat this huge swan-shaped cream puff, zura. Let's split it in half.
I wish our singing would really make it snow.
I'm so glad that I got a lead role in a musical with Mari.
Practicing with Mari was a lot of fun!
Let's make a white Christmas happen together, Riko.
I had such a shiny time playing a lead role with Riko.
Practicing with Riko made me realize all kinds of things.
Wow! The feet on the macarons I baked are perfect! I feel like something good will happen today.
Live shows or macarons, my heart pounds anxiously in the making, but the moment of success is unforgettable.
Buttercream, ganache, or jam... Just changing up the filling transforms the flavor of a macaron.
Gemstone candies fall apart in your mouth. They're sweet and tasty, and they always leave you wanting more.
Gemstone candies take time to finish drying. Just like growing up, it's important to take your time.
Will I be able to sparkle like a gemstone candy if I take time to grow up as well?
Linzer tortes aren't just sweet. They're tart from the red currants and feature a kick of spice.
Whether you eat them warm or cold from the fridge, the way you eat a pie tells a lot about your personality.
Tasting tarts both freshly-baked and chilled is what makes baking them at home so great. Which do you like?
The beginning of the year means a new year begins for me as well. It really makes me feel motivated.
To see in my birthday for this year, I decided to write down all that I aspire to accomplish.
Even though everyone is busy for New Year's they still made time to celebrate with me. I am so fortunate.
Numazu mikan oranges are left to ripen so they're packed with flavor! They're so tasty!
Wearing this costume really makes me wanna eat mikan oranges. Ahh, I love them!
I wanna show off everything great about mikan with this costume! So much so that I'll make you obsessed.
The ox's protective stone is sardonyx. Before you ask, I know my name is Dia, but it's not a diamond.
I hope we can show you a side of us you've never seen before.
Never lose your curiosity. A mind that always wants to know more will always help you grow.
This costume packs in everyone's ideas. It's so sweet and shiny!
Princess cakes are eaten on special occasions. I wonder what we should celebrate today?
Here we go! Time to kick off the sweets party. Entering dreamland now!
Roll cakes are fluffy and make for a super cute costume theme as well!
It's a costume created from wonderful ideas, so I want lots of people to see it.
Welcome to my cake shop! You ordered the roll cake, right?
I'm so happy that I got to be a princess on my birthday. I'm really looking forward to Rin's birthday.
Vega is the brightest star in the summer night sky. Maki taught me that.
Can I also shine brightly like Vega, I wonder? I want to keep growing and improving!
Even though I know I shouldn't, I cannot help myself when delicious Japanese sweets are given to me.
While carefully-made Japanese sweets are lovely to look at, they are so beautiful it pains me to eat them.
To eat sweet Japanese treats with a fragrant cup of tea. What an indulgent moment of happiness.
It's my birthday, so I want to share all this happiness with everyone as well. Will you accept it?
I wrote letters and put them into these origami rosettes. Here, this one's for you!
I want to celebrate even harder for everyone than they celebrated for me!
I'm pretty good at cutting up enough slices of a cake for everyone around to get a piece. Leave it to me!
Seeing people smile as they eat delicious sweets brings a smile to my face as well.
Do you eat the strawberries on top of cakes first or last? If you wanna know what I do, well...
Twinkling like a star with a gentle sweetness. I hope everyone listening to us feels that when we sing too.
Konpeito candies are tiny, but take a lot of time and effort to make. That's the key to their tastiness.
The moment something unexpected happens I have a bad habit of losing my composure. I have to be calmer, huh.
Because everyone celebrated it with me, it's the best birthday ever. I've gotta give everyone a hug!
I got lots of birthday presents with a star theme. Tonight, I just might be able to see a shooting star!
Apparently, Mari and Dia are going to gift me a shooting star. *Giggle* I can't wait to see.
Hakodate is colder than Uchiura, but the feelings I get when I meet Saint Snow are toasty and warm!
Now that we've powered up as Saint Aqours Snow, you'd better enjoy our live show with all your might too!
I've gotten lots of motivation from Sarah and Leah, so I'm in top form today!
The chill in the air in Hakodate is a bit different from Uchiura. It's a bracing chill that refreshes you.
I want Saint Snow and Aqours' melody to warm your heart. Look forward to it, okay?
I get lots of inspiration from spending time with Saint Snow. I really want to make it up to them.
Hey, were you just thinking you're cold? Shall I give you a hug? It will warm you right up!
We also became snowflakes here in Hakodate. Each in a different shape, but just as beautiful.
Sarah and Leah have such passion for practice! I feel like I need more practice too.
Scarf, check. Gloves, check. I'm prepared to face the cold. I'm going to relish Hakodate with Saint Snow!
I can feel how much we improve when we spend time with Saint Snow. I intend to reach even higher heights.
The bond that Saint Snow shares with us in Aqours is quite a peculiar one. I feel as though it's fate.
A magical live show, huh? Chika always comes up with the most interesting ideas.
I wonder why none of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals are sea creatures. There could at least be one.
The stuffed animal I'm carrying is a Chinese zodiac puppy. What breed is this supposed to be again? A Shiba?
It looks like the ships are moored at the port for the winter. Sarah and Leah are taking me to see them!
I love making friends where we inspire one another. I can't help but break into a grin. *Giggle* You too?
Doesn't Saint Aqours Snow seem like a big ship to you? Let's go full speed ahead towards tomorrow! Aye aye!
Saint Snow will guide us to the promised land where I'll restore my ancient memories and sealed-away powers.
I shall demonstrate my newly awakened powers to you atop Saint Aqours Snow's stage, my little demon!
The elation of performing a show with Saint Snow is second-to-none! I could fly forever on jet-black wings!
I wanna play with everyone in the snow, zura. Sarah and Leah are gonna teach us all sorts of games!
I've grown so much as a part of Saint Aqours Snow, zura! I want you to see how much I've improved, zura.
Standing on the same stage as Saint Snow... It's like a dream, zura!
The snow-covered town looks so pretty when it twinkles. It's giving the place a romantic air!
Everyone in Saint Aqours Snow is constantly improving and inspiring each other. It's so exciting!
Aqours had better take notes on Saint Snow's powerful, energetic performances!
Hakodate should be cold with all the snow everywhere, but since I'm with everyone I hardly feel cold at all!
I love both Aqours and Saint Snow. So I'm really, really happy we get to be Saint Aqours Snow!
I'll turn my nerves into strength so that I can do my Rubesty!
When it's my birthday, it feels like the whole world begins anew. Things are going to get even more fun!
Everyone got me a cake filled with red bean paste. It was so fancy-looking and delicious, zura!
What makes a birthday special is the people who celebrate it with you, zura. Thank you for everything, zura!
Our school library had a surprising amount of books about magic, zura.
The rat on my skirt looks like a gentleman because the ribbon around his neck looks like a bow tie, zura.
Every day is full of sparkling magic. I hope it never disappears.
Becoming a princess by wearing the costume Kotori made for me has made for the best birthday.
I've prepared a gift for all of you as well, full of my gratitude.
Shall we all take a group photo for my birthday? I will treasure it very much.
Hmm, a birthday wish? When you say I could ask for anything, that makes it all the more difficult.
I already can't wait to celebrate everyone else's birthdays. I'll give them the best day ever.
My surprise presents from everyone were all truly wonderful. I'm very happy.
Sometimes I get so focused on things that I get total tunnel vision, but...I'm glad to be with everyone!
I really love to sing! Being on stage as a school idol is the best feeling ever!
We're gonna put on the most exciting performance in the world. I hope you have fun, too!
Honoka's got so much energy. I wonder where she'll take us next?
I feel like it's a miracle that we met. I'll treasure this bond forever.
I want to make so many more school idol costumes. I'll never run out of ideas.
I'm excited to see what miracles Honoka will work with her power.
Obsessing over something so much you lose sight of everything around you is bliss, don't you think?
Your support gives me courage. Thank you for always being there for me.
I have so many dreams I wanna make them come true! I hope we can achieve them together one by one.
Everyone believes in our strength. That gives me so much courage.
I'm so glad I became a school idol! No matter what happens, I'll never give up!
I want to cherish these feelings within me forever.
I'll send my gratitude out to everyone for letting our songs spread far and wide.
I became a school idol because I wanted to change. It really worked!
I'm gonna make today another super fun live show! Let's get everyone pumped up together. Aye aye!
I can do things I can't do on my own when I'm with everyone else.
I know we can keep going because of your support, thanks as always!
Maybe I should add a message to the video of our live show. I can thank my parents in it!
Having someone other than my parents celebrate this day with me is pretty nice. I'm pleased.
I gathered up a lot of photos from the past to commemorate my birthday. Want to look at them with me?
I will sing as enchantingly as a mermaid.
Dressing up as a princess on my birthday makes me remember when I was crowned with a tiara once upon a time.
The Little Mermaid picture book's illustrations are all lovely. I may dream about being a mermaid tonight.
It's nice to wear a different color than usual. This can be my reason to tackle even greater heights.
Birthdays are special because you get to have everyone celebrate you. I'm having a great day!
Chika and You got me a new uniform as a present! I wanna try it on right away!
Maybe I should add a message to the video of our live show. I can thank my parents in it!
Having someone other than my parents celebrate this day with me is pretty nice. I'm pleased.
