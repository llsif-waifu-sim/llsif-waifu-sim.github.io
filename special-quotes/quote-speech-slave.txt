I think my birthday's the perfect occasion to give everyone a surprise. *Giggle* I hope they like it.
I've never had this many people come together to celebrate my birthday. It's a little embarrassing.
I'm so glad you all heard my song. I filled it with feelings of gratitude. It was my way of saying thanks.
*Giggle* Birthdays are always such happy days. So many people come up and wish you well!
I looked through my photo album on my birthday. Dia's always been looking after me, hasn't she?
Today's a special live show, so me and Dia got to stand center stage. I was so excited!
Since You invited me, I'm going to enjoy myself to my heart's content too!
It was You who named the inflatable raft. I've started to grow attached to it.
This inflatable raft looks like a toy, but it can actually travel quite far. We're on an adventure!
Boats really are the best! We can go anywhere on our inflatable raft, the SS You!
*Laugh* It's okay, Dia. You don't have to cling on so desperately.
Yeah, that's the way! I'm surprised by how great you are at rowing!
I'll remember the fluffy kindness of this sheep and deliver it to you during the live show.
We'll put you under a magic spell with our song.
I thought about giving the sheep open eyes, but I thought it gave off a kinder feeling with its eyes closed.
Here at last. The fallen angel's promised land, the magic metropolis, Tokyo! Here I come, my little demons.
The labyrinth of the magic metropolis warrants no fear before my magic eye! Come with me, Zuramaru and Ruby!
I can feel it. The darkness adorning the shining city lights is calling me, awaiting the time of my descent.
All right, sing along with us! Let's have a blast!
Don't worry! It's okay, because we'll always be together!
I can jump with all my might because I have You and Ruby by my side.
What does it mean to act like myself? I don't understand it yet, but I'm just gonna keep on running for now!
Let's press on, straight ahead! Don't be afraid because we'll be your guide!
Chika and Ruby, as long as I'm with the two of you, I can take on anything, head-first!
I'm gonna make sure you watch to see what I can do!
I can't just keep being scared. Even I get that now!
If Chika and You believe in me, then I'm gonna do my absolute Rubesty!
Can I bring this monkey home with me after the show? I want to keep it on my bed and sleep with it at night.
Thank you for always letting me stand on stage with happy feelings. I'll keep working hard!
I really like this monkey's eyebrows. Its slightly grumpy face is so cute!
Unlike stage costumes, Halloween ones are a little...embarrassing.
I also made some tomato cakes for Halloween. They're actually pretty good. Do you want one?
Halloween songs are a little spooky, but singing them with everyone makes them fun.
When someone says "trick or treat" to me, I always choose "treat"!
Jack-o'-lanterns are kinda interesting because there's a mix of cute ones and scary ones.
If you don't give me any candy, I'll pull a prank on you! If you do give me candy then... thanks? I guess?
In any language, maintaining eye contact with others in conversations is important. C'mon, give it a try.
Trying too hard to speak a foreign language will only bring nerves. Respect for the other person is key!
In a pinch, use gestures to speak with body language. Hey, Nozomi, that doesn't mean it's tickle time!
These cheerleader costumes came out really adorable!
Just wearing these matching cheerleading costumes is kind of making my heart flutter.
Pay close attention to my peppy cheerleader performance!
We also have to put our all into cheering so we don't get totally outshined by the sports clubs!
I'm sure at the end we'll all finish everything with a smile. The cards are telling me so.
Leave the passionate cheering to us!
I hope everyone at Otonokizaka can flourish. Gods, please make my wish come true.
Nozomi, Kotori, and I all made our wishes together, so I'm sure they'll have an immediate effect!
I'll give my all to cheer you on! Do your best, Otonokizaka!
I think Nozomi's fortune might be right, I'm gonna have the best day. Really gotta make my birthday special!
I'm glad I get to spend my birthday with you as well. Look forward to Alisa's special borscht!
Alisa planned my birthday party for me today. I'm really looking forward to it right now!
Ruby picked out temporary tattoos that would look good on me!
I got to walk around town, which was all decorated up for Halloween, with Ruby. It was fun, zura!
I really can't wait for our Halloween party, zura! I'm grateful to Yoshiko too, zura!
Temporary tattoos are so cute, aren't they? I wonder which ones will look the best on Hanamaru?
I tried to come up with the perfect Halloween outfits. Let's wear them together, later!
Hanamaru, Yoshiko, and I are going to have a party together. We did so much to prepare for it.
All the clothes in Tokyo are so stylish. There's so much to learn from just looking around like this.
Hanamaru, Yoshiko, and I all picked out some clothes. I'm gonna dress them up and add my own spin later!
I'm so glad I got to come to Tokyo with them. I'll do my Rubesty so we can make another trip!
*Giggle* Posing without a bow is difficult. You, does something like this look all right to you?
Hanamaru was kind enough to do a lot of research, and that deepened my interest in sports.
Kyudo is a martial art meant to hone the mind, while archery is a sport meant to hone physical skill.
I'm gonna run through a bunch of poses. Hanamaru, Dia, make sure you both get plenty of photos!
It seems like putting on fencing gear really improves my posture. It feels natural to pose in, too.
I tried my hand at a fencing trial lesson and it was a lot of fun. I'd love to give it another go!
Thanks to You's idea we collected a bunch of uniforms. I'm having so much fun, zura!
To me, fall was all about reading, but a fall full of sports is pretty exciting too.
Apparently, it's bad for horses to eat leafy vegetables. I had no idea, zura!
There's a magic spell that only affects those who watch our performances. You already know of it, right?
Today, we'll use our magic to bring you to a Harasho world. Are you ready?
You have to put important feelings into words. Thank you for everything. You're very special to me.
I wish every day was my birthday. That way I'd get treated to a feast every day!
I got a kitty-cat blanket as a present from everyone! It feels so amazingly soft!
No matter how cold it might be, I feel all nice and warm when I'm with everyone.
Somehow, seeing the fall-colored landscape tugs at my heartstrings and makes me feel wistful.
Wearing costumes with Japanese-style designs automatically makes me stand up straighter. I wonder why?
From the bottom of my heart, I'm truly happy to have friends that'll come to my rescue when I'm in trouble.
I tried to mix a more Japanese-style, subdued look with a flashier Western-style. How'd I do?
Japanese style and Western style look like different concepts, but they're adorable if you blend them well.
I tried to design this costume to evoke fall imagery, but it'd probably suit any season.
I tried matching my hairstyle to my outfit. Does the ponytail suit me?
The frills are supposed to look like whipped cream. They're fluffy and make me feel very sweet!
I feel like I could go to the land of candy in this costume. Maybe I'll try to embody that in our next song.
I'm gonna cast a super fun magic spell on you. *Giggle* It's a spell that'll make you smile.
I borrowed Honoka's magic wand. Now I'm a great witch, too!
I feel like this cloak will let me fly through the sky. Just one big leap to wherever you are!
Simmering miso soup after adding ingredients will enrich the flavor, but the aroma may fade, so be careful.
Bread's not bad either, but in the mornings, I definitely love to have my rice and my miso soup!
Ah, Rin, you've got some rice stuck to your mouth. Hehe, there, I got it for you.
Go! Go! Otonokizaka!
It's important to cheer with everything you have, and not act shy about it. Allegedly.
Honoka and the others are going to come cheer at the archery match. It's a bit embarrassing.
Maki! Umi! Let's get fired up!
It's so fun to be cheering with everyone!
When I see all the athletes working so hard, it makes me want to cheer even louder for them.
